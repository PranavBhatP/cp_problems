# Hi There! Welcome to my sub-part of this repository

My name is Calisto. I am currently a First Year student studying here in the IT Branch. I have been into competitive coding for the past two months. I am currently a noob at this but am looking to get better. Mostly, I solve questions from the CodeForces question banks. I haven't taken part in any of the contests yet and don't have a rating for the same reason.

1. **Rating**: Unrated
2. **Level I am able to solve comfortably as of now**: Level 3 (Mostly the first 1 or 2 Questions)
3. **Frequency of Solving**: As of now, I don't solve questions very regularly as I have not yet set a daily slot for CP but I aim on doing that in the near future.
4. CodeForces Account: (https://codeforces.com/profile/Calisto_Mathias)

## How I am going to organize my sub-repository:

1. The text file 'Questions_Solved.md' will contain all the Questions that I have solved. I will link the question hyperlink as well as write the Question code next to it. 
2. If I have found a solution to the question, I will upload a sub-folder for it which contains the C++ code solution as well as a short, succint explanation (If I am able to explain it XD)

## Feedback:

If in case you want to discuss either my solution or a better approach to the question, you may text me through Whatsapp on +91 8861257917.
