# cp_problems

## For anyone who is a collaborator on this repo, make sure you tend to the following rules.

### 1.Everytime you encounter any cp problem(regardless of the platform of origin), try to copy the solution onto a corresponding file of required extension
### 2.Also create a .txt or .md file with a brief explanation of your solution.
### 3. 1 contribution per week is enough.
### 4. Make sure that each contributor has his own separate branch for his/her solutions to be posted.
### 5. In the main branch, there will be a single folder called "CP Problems", where you can add individual ".txt" files for each of the problems, with the hyperlink and a small side note pointing to the location of the solution(i.e your branch_name and name of solution file).
### 6. You can do whatever you want on your own branch, but never pollute the main branch.
### 7. Enjoy1
