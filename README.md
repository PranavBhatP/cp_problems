# Competitive Programming Questions

## For the collaborators:
This repository is meant to aid students like us to get into and collaborate while pursuing our interests in Competitive Programming. In light of this, it is better if we all follow some guidelines to make our lives easier.

1. Whenever you find a question that is particularly intriguing, you are advised to add it into the **Questions.txt** file.
2. Make a sub-folder with your name incase you post a solution code to any one of the questions in the **Questions.txt** file. This would help all the other collaborators to make the best use of this repository. In this subfolder, either make sub-folders with the name of an easily recognizable problem or make a folder with the question code of the particular question. Please make sure to add a seperate file for your code as well as an **Explanation.txt** file so that others may try and grasp how your solution functions.
3. You are free to make as many commits as you want throughout the week. 
4. Please do not upload random spam in this repository.

## How to commit into this Repository:

1. In the main branch of the repository, there will be a folder 'CP Problems'. You may add a seperate text file for each question with the filenaming as follows: Problem Title+Problem Source.txt
2. Inside this text file, add a link to the original problem source, as well as a link to the solution if you have come up with one (Should be uploaded into your folder) . This link should point to a point in your subfolder.

## Inside your Folder:

1. Inside your subfolder, you may do whatever you like. But as a guideline, make two folders
	1. One for your solutions and explanations
	2. One for everything else
2. Inside the folder for the solutions, maintain subfolders for each question with its Title as the folder name so that others may find it easy to access your solutions.

## Resources:

1. There will also be a folder in the main repository. This will be the 'Resources' Folder. You may upload any resources or hyperlinks in a text file so that others may refer to these sources.

## Learning Github:

To learn Github, you can use many resources. Please create a branch out of the main repository so that you don't end up meddling around with the wrong files. Once all the changes have been made final, you would be allowed to have a pull request into the main repository.

In short, Follow the follow steps:
1. Make a branch of the official Main repository
2. Make all your changes through that.
3. Perform a Pull request.
4. Merge it with the main channel if everything goes fine :)

***Last but not least: Have a great time doing Competitive Programming and remain consistent.***
