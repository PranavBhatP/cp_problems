# Competitive Programming Questions

## For the collaborators:

This repository is meant to aid students like us to get into and collaborate while pursuing our interests in Competitive Programming. In light of this, it is better if we all follow some guidelines to make our lives easier.

1. Whenever you find a question that is particularly intriguing, you are advised to add it into the **Questions.txt** file.
2. Make a sub-folder with your name incase you post a solution code to any one of the questions in the **Questions.txt** file. This would help all the other collaborators to make the best use of this repository. In this subfolder, either make sub-folders with the name of an easily recognizable problem or make a folder with the question code of the particular question. Please make sure to add a seperate file for your code as well as an **Explanation.txt** file so that others may try and grasp how your solution functions.
3. You are free to make as many commits as you want throughout the week. 
4. Please do not upload random spam in this repository.
