# Hi there!!! Welcome to my sub-part of this repo

My name is Rijul. I am a first year student in IT branch. I have been into competitive coding for almost two years now but haven't had the time to practice or learn a lot. So, I'm definitely looking to get better. 

My language of choice is JAVA. JAVA is one of the most widely used languages for development and is a pretty fast language. Its machine indepent i.e. it can run code on any machine without making any significant changes making it a highly popular and in-demand language. It is pretty versatile with many libraries and can be used for a range of applications. JAVA is also one of the most used languages for problem solving and DSA.


## How I am going to organize this sub-repo:

1. The text file "Questions.md" will contain all the questions that I have solved. I will also be providing a hyperlink to the question.
2. The file Boilerplate.java contains the boilerplate code for solving a problem in JAVA. In this code, I have imported the basic libraries used and have taken in put for 't' test cases. You only need to take input for each test case and write your logic and output inside the while loop.
3. The solution java file will be named according to the question name. In that I will be writing the JAVA code for the solution followed by an explanation(if I am able to explain it :D) in the comments after the code.
